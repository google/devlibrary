              The submission to publication process takes around one month. As soon as you submit your content, you will receive an email confirming your submission has been successfully received. It takes 2-4 weeks for your content to be reviewed. After the review, you will receive an email stating whether the project was accepted or not. ( If you don’t see an email, make sure to check your spam or promotions folder). Post the approval email, it can take another 1-2 weeks for the submission to be published to your author profile.
