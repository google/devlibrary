# Development

## Note

This file is *only* for Googlers. External contributors will not be able to successfully follow the instructions here.

## Setup / Install

  * Make sure you have Node.js 16 installed
  * In the `app`, `functions` and `shared` directory:
    * `npm install`

## Run Locally

## Dev Server

In the `app` directory:

```
npm run serve
```
If you face an error like: `Syntax Error: Error: error while parsing tsconfig.json`, then you must have some unsubmitted
changes to the repo while figuring out other errors or installing anything in the node_modules, so discard those changes before running the run serve command

Make sure you have access to the Firebase projects, if you haven't contact Sam.
Once you have the access, you need to make sure your local environment is using the firebase project

So try these commands:

```
npx firebase login # this will ask for login on the browser for access to firebase CLI
npx firebase use ugc-site-dev

```
Then, make sure you have java installed in your machine, because the firebase emulator will need java runtime.

Now download the local configuration for the Functions emulator by running this command from inside the `functions` directory:

```
firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json
```

In a second terminal in the `functions` directory which will build and run the emulator 

```
npm run serve
```

You can see the local emulator now in http://localhost:4000/
And the local instance at http://localhost:8080/

Note: 

To seed the Firestore emulator with some data, hit this endpoint in your browser:
http://localhost:5001/ugc-site-dev/us-central1/refreshProjects

## Deployment

To deploy the frontend and backend together, use Google Cloud Build to run `cloudbuild/deploy.yaml`.
This will automatically deploy the correct configuration based on the environment.

### Cloud Functions config

Note that the Functions have the following required configuration (already set up):

  * `github.token`
  * `elastic.id`
  * `elastic.username`
  * `elastic.password`

All configuration values are stored in Valentine with the `[dev-ugc]` prefix.
