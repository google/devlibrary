  "description": "Here, I adopt a generative and semantic approach to clusterize pedagogical projects in Colombia. I will OCR the documents (pedagogical projects), translate them to English, summarize them (LLM), generate embeddings (LLM) and use unsupervised learning to generate groups of similar content. This allows the Departments of Education to organize and segment different educational strategies in clusters, according to the semantic similarity of their pedagogical projects, in order to make educational management easier and more effective."
