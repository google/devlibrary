  "description": "In this report, I would like to introduce a sample script for efficiently deleting rows by conditions on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. Recently, I had a situation for being required to achieve this situation. In my report, it has already known that when Sheets API is used, the rows can be efficiently deleted by a condition. Ref However, in that case, Sheets API couldnâ€™t be used. Under this situation, I came up with a method. In this report, I would like to introduce this method."
